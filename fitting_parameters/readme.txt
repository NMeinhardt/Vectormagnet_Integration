Predictions based on a cubic regression fit of measurement data aquired during the config_tests or later.

model_poly3_latest_B2I.sav and model_poly3_latest_I2B.sav originated from fitting 21_01_27_04-33-07_field_meas.csv

model_poly3_final_B2I.sav and model_poly3_final_I2B.sav originated from fitting 21_02_02_14-44-29_field_meas.csv


for the following, a total of 12 measurements (2 along each axis, 2 rotations around each axis) from the folder 
C:\Users\Magnebotix\Desktop\Qzabre_Vector_Magnet\1_Version_2_Vector_Magnet\1_data_analysis_interpolation\Data_Analysis_For_VM\data_sets\repeatability_error_source_search\with_bad_model
were used as fitting data:
model_QSM_poly1_nooffset_B2I.sav is a linear model with no offset based on measurements made in the QSM setup
model_QSM_poly1_offset_B2I.sav is a linear affine model based on measurements made in the QSM setup

model_QSM_poly3_nooffset_B2I.sav is a cubic model with no offset based on measurements made in the QSM setup
model_QSM_poly3_offset_B2I.sav is a cubic affine model based on measurements made in the QSM setup
NOTE: models with and without offset are in fact identical.
